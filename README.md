# SKOP API

The SKOP API is a javascript API for one-to-one video calls between a patient and a doctor, using a medical device : the Skop.


## Usage

```html

<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset='utf-8'/>
	</head>
	<body>

		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	
	</body>
	<script src="Skop.js"></script>
</html>

```

The file is imported directly from the folder.

**It will be possible to just call the script for the web in the future**
